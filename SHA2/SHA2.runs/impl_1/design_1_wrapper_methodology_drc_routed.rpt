2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.013 ns between design_1_i/sha256IPCoProcessor_0/U0/sha256IPCoProcessor_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/W_reg[41][8]/C (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0) and design_1_i/sha256IPCoProcessor_0/U0/sha256IPCoProcessor_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/s_a_reg[22]/D (clocked by clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_1_0).
